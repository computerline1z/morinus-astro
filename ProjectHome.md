# Morinus (modern version) - astrology program on Mac #

**Morinus** is an easy to use astrology software under GPLv3 license which means a **free for all users**. It uses the [Swiss ephemeris](http://www.astro.com/) so it's very accurate (5000BC - 5000AD). Morinus software exists in two versions, modern version ([see here](https://sites.google.com/site/pymorinus/)) and traditional version ([see here](https://sites.google.com/site/tradmorinus/morinus)).

It runs on every operating system where _Python_ and _wxPython_ are available (Linux, Unix, Windows, Mac OS X). This project site contains only Mac OS X version of modern version of program. Other versions, including other platforms, see the external links section links on this site.

This Mac OS X version is based on Morinus 6.2 for MS Windows. Program has been tested on following Mac OS X versions (10.8.x, 10.7.x and 10.6.x), there is no guarantee that program will run on other Mac OS X versions (10.5.x and earlier). I have no machine with these operating system versions :-(
