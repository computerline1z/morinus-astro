Readme file to Mac OSX version of Morinus Python program.

Morinus is an easy to use astrology software under GPLv3 license. It uses the swiss ephemeris so it's very accurate (5000BC - 5000AD). 
It runs on every Operating System where Python and wxPython are available (Linux, Unix, Windows, MacOS).

This Mac OSX version is based on Morinus 6.2 for MS Windows. This version has been tested on Mac OSX Lion (version 10.7.4), there is no guarantee that program will run on other Mac OSX versions (10.5.x, 10.6.x). I have no machine with these operating system versions :-(
